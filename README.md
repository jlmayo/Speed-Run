### **The Repository**
This repository (Speed-Runner) contains HTML code, CSS stylesheets, and script.js files for Javascript code. Each contributor has a branch that has been merged with main. Some use has been made of GitHub Project workflow. This is a submission for University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp's Project 1 assignment.

### **The Scenario**
As a team, we were tasked with conceiving of and executing a design for a a real-world front-end application. This application should solve a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Other goals of this project were the utilization of agile development methodologies in order to work collaboratively and implementing feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests. 

To plan the project, the team was required to compose a user story and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues and use GitHub Project to track the status of project and tasks assigned. The goal was for the team to understand the benefits of Kanban boards.

### **The Project**
Speed-Runner is an application that provides information on recent video game releases, including trailers, rankings, and a sign up to receive timely information from the app. It also tracks user location to (in the future) provide accurate local shopping options.

### **User Story**
* AS A gamer
* I WANT an application that shows me current information on the most popular video games
* SO THAT I can find my new favorite game.

### **Requirements Outstanding**
* 

### **Result**
The app is very pleasant to look at and the functionality is halfway there.
